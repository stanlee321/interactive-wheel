 Using javascript and css(non-svg) to make an hold-and-drag wheel menu.


 the images are not distributed evenly over the wheel.png , can you draw the center of images over the slots of the main wheel?


 can you crate an interactive wheel using HTML, CSS and JS  for the Sustainable Development Goals if I provide you with the wheel background png image and the 17 related icons?
